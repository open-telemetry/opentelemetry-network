## Notes:
##  * In most cases, any metric measurement should have all dimensions available from the dimensions document available in both source and destination form.
##  * Often, dimensions that are not available will have a value of '(unknown)', '-' or similar.
##  * All metrics from Network Explorer are currently provided with 30 second resolution.

http.client.duration_average:
  brief: Average client HTTP response time in ms.
  description: |
    This metric is the average duration in microseconds from when the client sends an HTTP request, until the response is received back from the server.
