/**
 * hash - routines for hashing bytes
 *
 * When creating a hash table it's important to have a hash function
 * which mixes well and is fast.  This package supplies such functions.
 *
 * The hash functions come in two flavors: the normal ones and the
 * stable ones.  The normal ones can vary from machine-to-machine and
 * may change if we find better or faster hash algorithms in future.
 * The stable ones will always give the same results on any computer,
 * and on any version of this package.
